### Methods

#### Why does ASN survey nephrology fellows in training?

Since 2014, ASN has conducted an annual fellow survey to understand:
- The composition of the incoming workforce, including race, ethnicity, and gender
- Motivating factors for choosing the specialty to tailor approaches to sustain interest in nephrology
- Potential gaps in nephrology education
- Demand for nephrologists in the U.S.

#### How was the survey constructed?

The survey instrument comprised:
- Longitudinal questions drawn from the original 2014 survey focusing on job search experiences, perceptions of the specialty, practice patterns, and demographics
- Questions developed by the ASN Data Subcommittee to assess nephrology fellowsâ€™ training experiences and perceptions of the specialty.

The final instrument was piloted by ASN Data Subcommittee members and distributed via Qualtrics.

#### Who were surveyed?

The 2024 ASN Nephrology Fellow Survey was distributed to a survey frame of 962 adult, pediatric, and adult/pediatric nephrology fellows drawn from the ASN (869 adult fellows) and American Society for Pediatric Nephrology (93 fellows) member databases. T he survey received a 46% response rate, with participation from 393 adult, 45 pediatric, and 9 adult/pediatric fellows in training.

A separate Transplant Fellow Survey was developed for transplant nephrology fellows and distributed to 18 transplant fellows provided by current transplant fellowship TPDs. Of these, 9 participated (50% response rate).
When was the survey conducted?

Invitation emails were sent to adult fellows on April 30 (May 7 for the Transplant Fellow Survey) and the survey closed on May 22, 2024. Participating fellows were eligible to win one of 10 complimentary one-year ASN memberships or one of two complimentary BRCU registrations.

#### How were responses analyzed?

The ASN Nephrology Fellow Survey was reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Research Board (Study # 00205206). Data obtained from 2024 responses were analyzed using R (R Core Team (2024). R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing.
